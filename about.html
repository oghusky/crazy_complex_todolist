  <h1>About The Crazy Complex TodoList</h1>
  <h3>Here are a list of reasons why this simple app is called complex</h3>
  <!-- project points -->
  <section id="points">
    <p>Disclaimer: I know the UI isn't great. But, the functionality implementation is!</p>
    <h2>1. No libraries (Not even bootstrap)</h2>
    <p>No bootstrap, no jquery, this app is only using vanilla HTML, CSS, JS and alot of elbow grease. All functionality
      is dynamically created and accessed using JS ES6. </p>
    <h2>2. A little OOP behind the scenes</h2>
    <code>
      <pre>
        class TodoItem {
          constructor(text, isUrgent) {
            this.text = text;
            this.isUrgent = isUrgent;
            this.today = new Date();
          }
          ...// things happened here check
          ...// it out in the github repo
        }
      </pre>
    </code>
    <p>Though the user only has to enter text and tap submit, there is a little bit of OOP going on behind the scenes.
      If the user chooses to
      mark ther todo item as an "urgent" or not, there's a method on each new todo created to check that value. If it is
      urgent the background is red and text white.
      If marked as not urgent the background is green and the text white. Otherwise the background grey and text black.
    </p>
    <h2>3. Full CRUD using localStorage (without reloading the page)</h2>
    <p>That's right you can Create Read Update AND Delete. One of the coolest parts was figuring out how to update in
      place without reloading the page. When the "&Cross;" or "&trisb;" buttons are clicked actions happen in place. The
      "&Cross;" button deletes
      the current todo item and the "&trisb;" button reveals an input for the user to be able to update the todo text in
      place.</p>
    <p>Psssst.... no e.preventDefault() either &#128521;(wink noise). Just alot of functions passing things around to
      other functions.</p>
    <h2>4. No spaghetti code</h2>
    <p>There's not ONE variable declared globally in the whole program. All variables are encapsulated inside of the
      functions they are needed.</p>
